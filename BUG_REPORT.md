## ⚠️ KNOWN NON-CRITICAL ISSUES

### Map Widget Not Rendering - FIXED (2025-07-13)

**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (2025-07-13)

## Description

The `PropertyMapWidget` in `desktop/src/ui/map_widget.py` was not rendering correctly. The `QWebEngineView` displayed a blank map and the application's log showed a recurring JavaScript error: `js: Uncaught ReferenceError: L is not defined`.

This error indicated that the Leaflet.js library, which `folium` depends on, was not being loaded correctly within the web view.

**Impact:** Non-critical - Application functioned normally, CMA system worked, but map visualization was not available.

## Resolution (2025-07-13)

The issue was resolved by implementing the following fixes:

1. **QWebEngineSettings Configuration:** Added proper web engine settings to allow external content:
   - `JavascriptEnabled`: True
   - `LocalContentCanAccessRemoteUrls`: True
   - `LocalContentCanAccessFileUrls`: True

2. **JavaScript Console Monitoring:** Added a console message handler to detect and respond to JavaScript errors.

3. **Deferred Leaflet Initialization:** Wrapped the map initialization code to wait for Leaflet.js to fully load from CDN before attempting to use the `L` object.

4. **DOM Ready Handling:** Added proper DOM ready event handling to ensure the page is fully loaded before initializing the map.

The fix ensures that the Leaflet library loads completely from the CDN before any map initialization code runs, preventing the "L is not defined" error.

# Incomplete Feature: Flipping Analyzer

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## Description

The `FlippingAnalyzer` in `desktop/src/core/flipping_analyzer.py` is a placeholder and not a complete implementation. It currently only implements the 70% rule and does not perform a comprehensive analysis.

## Next Steps

The `FlippingAnalyzer` needs to be fully implemented with more sophisticated analysis techniques, such as:

*   Detailed cost analysis (holding costs, closing costs, etc.)
*   Profit projections
*   Risk assessment
*   Integration with market data to validate ARV

# Incomplete Feature: Plasma Integration

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## Description

The `PlasmaIntegration` module (`desktop/src/core/plasma_integration.py`) is currently a stub and does not provide any functional KDE Plasma integration.

## Next Steps

Implement actual KDE Plasma integration features, such as:

*   Global shortcut registration
*   System tray integration
*   Notifications
*   KRunner integration (if applicable)

# Incomplete Feature: Public Data Scraper - Data Extraction

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## Description

The `PublicPropertyScraper` (`desktop/src/core/public_data_scraper.py`) has been updated to use SearXNG for discovering the URLs of county assessor and other public data portals. However, the actual extraction of structured property data from these diverse government websites remains largely unimplemented.

Each county/state often has a unique website structure, requiring specific parsing logic for each. The current implementation includes placeholders for this county-specific logic (e.g., `_scrape_king_county_wa`).

## Next Steps

To fully utilize the public data scraper, detailed scraping logic needs to be developed for each target public data source (e.g., county assessor, tax records, deed records). This involves:

*   Analyzing the HTML structure of each specific public data portal.
*   Implementing `BeautifulSoup` (or similar) parsing rules to extract relevant fields (e.g., assessed value, year built, owner information, tax history, sale history).
*   Handling pagination, CAPTCHAs, and other anti-scraping measures if encountered.
*   Potentially integrating with public APIs if available for specific government data sources.

# Limitation: Major Real Estate Portal Scraping

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## Description

Attempts to directly scrape data from major real estate portals (Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com) using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` have been unsuccessful due to aggressive anti-scraping measures (e.g., `403 Forbidden` errors).

While SearXNG can locate the URLs for these sites, fetching and parsing their content programmatically is being actively blocked.

## Impact

This limitation means that the `PropertyScraper` (`desktop/src/core/property_scraper.py`) cannot reliably provide real-time property data from these sources. The application will need to rely on MLS integrations or other data sources for comprehensive property information.

## Next Steps

*   Consider alternative data acquisition strategies for these major portals, such as:
    *   Utilizing official APIs (if available and accessible).
    *   Exploring commercial data providers.
    *   Implementing more advanced scraping techniques (e.g., headless browsers, CAPTCHA solving services, sophisticated proxy rotation) if absolutely necessary and within project scope (which is currently outside the scope of simple `requests`/`BeautifulSoup`).
*   Update the `PropertyScraper` to clearly indicate when data from these sources is unavailable or unreliable.

# Feature Enhancement: Robust CMS with SQLAlchemy ORM

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## Description

The application's internal Content Management System (CMS) for managing leads, properties, campaigns, and tasks has been significantly enhanced. The previous implementation relied on raw SQL queries, which limited maintainability and advanced data manipulation capabilities.

This enhancement migrates all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for these core entities to use SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). This provides a more robust, Pythonic, and feature-rich way to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

## Impact

*   **Improved Maintainability:** Database interactions are now abstracted through Python objects, making the code cleaner and easier to understand and modify.
*   **Enhanced Querying:** SQLAlchemy ORM enables complex queries, filtering, and sorting with Python objects, reducing the need for raw SQL strings.
*   **Data Validation (Future):** The ORM provides a foundation for implementing more sophisticated data validation at the application level.
*   **Relationship Management (Future):** Easier definition and management of relationships between different entities (e.g., leads associated with properties, tasks assigned to leads).
*   **Portability:** While still tied to PostgreSQL, the ORM layer makes it theoretically easier to switch to other SQL databases in the future if needed.

## Implementation Details

*   **`desktop/src/core/models.py`:** New file created to define SQLAlchemy ORM models for `Lead`, `Property`, `Campaign`, and `Task` entities, mirroring the `init.sql` schema.
*   **`desktop/src/core/enhanced_colonel_client.py`:** All `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `get` methods for leads, properties, campaigns, and tasks have been refactored to utilize the SQLAlchemy ORM sessions and models.

# Feature Enhancement: Enhanced Leads Management
