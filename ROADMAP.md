# Real Estate Command Center - Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic enhancements to evolve the Real Estate Command Center into an even more feature-rich, functional, and valuable product for real estate agents.

## Phase 1: Production Data Integration (High Priority)

This phase focuses on integrating with real-world data sources to move beyond simulated data, providing agents with live, accurate, and comprehensive information.

### Key Initiatives:

*   **Real MLS API Integration**:
    *   Implement connectors for specific MLS APIs (e.g., RentSpree, MLSGrid, Bridge Interactive).
    *   Develop data parsing and mapping logic for various MLS data formats.
    *   Integrate live listing data, historical sales, and comprehensive property details into the application's property service.
*   **Live Market Data**:
    *   Display real-time market statistics (listings, sales, price changes, inventory) within the Dashboard and Market Research agent.
    *   Develop data refresh mechanisms.
*   **Property Photos & Virtual Tours**:
    *   Integrate fetching and displaying high-resolution property images and virtual tour links from MLS or other property data sources.
    *   Enhance CMA reports and property analysis views to include these visuals.
*   **School District Integration**:
    *   Integrate with school data APIs or databases to display school ratings, boundaries, and performance data for properties.

## Phase 2: Automation & Workflow (Medium Priority)

This phase aims to automate repetitive tasks and streamline agent workflows, significantly boosting productivity and efficiency.

### Key Initiatives:

*   **Email Marketing Automation**:
    *   Develop an in-app email composer and template management system.
    *   Implement drip campaign logic (scheduling, triggers, personalization).
    *   Integrate with an email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) or a local SMTP server.
*   **Document Generation**:
    *   Create a module for generating common real estate documents (contracts, offers, agreements).
    *   Implement template management and dynamic data population from lead/property data.
    *   Integrate with PDF generation libraries (e.g., ReportLab, already used for CMA, but for general documents).
*   **Calendar Integration & Appointment Scheduling**:
    *   Integrate with popular calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) for two-way sync of appointments.
    *   Develop a client-facing scheduling interface (if applicable, for agents to share).
*   **Notification System**:
    *   Implement robust SMS and email notification triggers for critical events such as new leads, significant market changes, upcoming follow-ups, and document deadlines.
    *   Integrate with SMS gateway (e.g., Twilio).

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Portfolio Management (Medium Priority)

This phase focuses on providing deeper insights and sophisticated tools for investment analysis and managing multiple properties, catering to agents working with investors or managing their own portfolios.

### Key Initiatives:

*   **Predictive Price Modeling**:
    *   Leverage advanced AI/ML models to forecast property values and market trends.
    *   Implement features to visualize price predictions and market trends.
*   **Investment Analysis Tools**:
    *   Add comprehensive features for calculating Return on Investment (ROI), cash flow, capitalization rates (cap rates), and other crucial investment metrics.
    *   Provide scenario analysis for different investment strategies.
*   **Market Prediction Algorithms**:
    *   Develop more sophisticated algorithms to predict future market shifts, identify emerging opportunities, and anticipate potential downturns.
*   **Portfolio Management**:
    *   Introduce tools for tracking and optimizing multiple properties, including performance monitoring, expense tracking, and potentially tenant management features.

## II. Application Settings & Configuration

Beyond the core features, a robust application needs comprehensive settings:

*   **API Key Management UI**: A secure in-app interface to manage API keys (OpenAI, MLS, Email, SMS, etc.) without needing to set environment variables. This would involve encryption and secure storage.
*   **AI Model Configuration**:
    *   UI to select preferred AI models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, or switch back to Ollama models).
    *   Settings for AI temperature, token limits, and other parameters.
*   **Data Source Preferences**: UI to prioritize or enable/disable specific property data sources (e.g., Zillow simulation, Redfin simulation, or future MLS integrations).
*   **Theming & Customization**: More granular control over UI themes, fonts, and color schemes beyond `qt-material`.
*   **Report Customization**: Options for agents to customize CMA and other report templates (branding, sections, disclaimers).
*   **Notification Preferences**: Granular control over which notifications are received and via which channel (email, SMS, in-app).
*   **User Profile Management**: Settings for agent's own profile, contact information, and branding.

## III. Core Application Enhancements

*   **Database Integration**: Currently, leads and campaigns seem to be in-memory. A persistent database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) is crucial for data integrity and scalability.
*   **Error Handling & Logging**: More sophisticated error reporting, user-friendly error messages, and robust logging for debugging and support.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization**: If multiple users or team features are envisioned, a secure login system and role-based access control.
*   **Data Import/Export**: Enhanced CSV/JSON import/export for all data types (properties, comparables, market data).
*   **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search, sorting, and filtering capabilities across all data tables (leads, properties, campaigns).
*   **Performance Optimization**: Continuous profiling and optimization for large datasets and complex AI interactions.
*   **Offline Mode**: If feasible, allow basic functionality when offline, syncing data when connectivity is restored.

## IV. UI/UX Improvements

*   **Interactive Dashboards**: More dynamic and customizable dashboards with drag-and-drop widgets for key metrics (lead pipeline, market trends, campaign performance).
*   **Enhanced Data Visualization**: More interactive charts and graphs beyond static Matplotlib outputs.
*   **Guided Workflows**: Improved wizards and step-by-step guides for complex tasks like CMA generation or campaign setup.
*   **Accessibility**: Ensuring the application is usable for individuals with disabilities.
*   **Responsiveness**: While a desktop app, ensuring layouts adapt well to different window sizes and resolutions.
*   **Onboarding & Tooltips**: In-app tutorials, tooltips, and contextual help for new features.

## V. Testing and Quality Assurance

*   **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Expand test coverage for all new and existing modules, especially for data processing, API integrations, and AI logic.
*   **Integration Tests**: Ensure seamless interaction between different components (UI, data services, AI backend).
*   **End-to-End Tests**: Automated tests simulating user workflows.
*   **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking and stress testing, especially for AI and data-intensive operations.
*   **Security Audits**: Regular checks for vulnerabilities, especially with API key handling and external integrations.

## VI. Deployment and Maintenance

*   **Packaging & Distribution**: Create installers for various Linux distributions (e.g., .deb, .rpm) and potentially other OS (Windows, macOS if PySide6 allows).
*   **Update Mechanism**: Implement an in-app update system for seamless software upgrades.
*   **Documentation**: Comprehensive user manuals, developer guides, and API documentation.
*   **Support & Feedback Channels**: Easy ways for users to report bugs, request features, and get support.

**Note on AI Integration Strategy:**
Initially, we will integrate with external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) using the provided `bolt.diy` API template (`/home/ucadmin/Development/real-estate-command-center/bolt-api-keys-template.json`). This approach will allow for rapid development and testing of new AI-powered features. Once core functionality and usability are established, we will explore transitioning to local models for cost optimization and enhanced privacy, aligning with the project's original vision.
