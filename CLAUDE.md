## Key Success: PySide6 Migration Completed

### What We Accomplished (2025-06-25)
1. **Resolved Critical Blocker**: Previous sessions failed to launch app due to missing QAction in pip-installed PySide6 wheels
2. **System Package Solution**: Successfully installed PySide6 via Ubuntu system packages instead of pip
3. **Complete Import Migration**: Converted entire codebase from PyQt5 → PySide6
4. **Qt6 Compatibility**: Fixed Qt6 breaking changes (QAction moved from QtWidgets to QtGui)

### Technical Details
- **Python**: Use system Python `/usr/bin/python3` (NOT Conda)
- **PySide6 Version**: 6.8.3 via system packages
- **Launch Command**: `cd desktop && /usr/bin/python3 src/main.py`
- **Packages Installed**: python3-pyside6.qtcore, qtgui, qtwidgets, qtuitools, qt-material, qtawesome

- **Theme**: qt-material with dark_amber.xml theme
- **Features**: 4-tab interface (Dashboard, Leads, Marketing, Database)
- **Launch**: Ready to run on GUI desktop environment

## Important Notes for Future Sessions
1. **Always use system Python**: `/usr/bin/python3` (not `python3` which points to Conda)
2. **System packages work**: Don't attempt pip install for PySide6
3. **QAction import**: From `PySide6.QtGui`, not `QtWidgets` (Qt6 change)
4. **Display**: SSH sessions will show display errors - run locally on desktop

## How to Test the AI System RIGHT NOW

### **🎯 CORRECT Launch Method**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to desktop directory (IMPORTANT!)
cd /home/ucadmin/Development/real-estate-command-center/desktop

# 2. Launch with system Python (NOT venv, NOT conda)
/usr/bin/python3 src/main.py
```

### **🔧 If Missing Dependencies**
```bash
sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install requests shortuuid --break-system-packages
```

### **⚠️ CRITICAL Launch Notes**
- **✅ DO**: Use system Python `/usr/bin/python3`
- **✅ DO**: Run from `desktop` directory (not `desktop/src`)
- **❌ DON'T**: Use virtual environment (causes PySide6 issues)
- **❌ DON'T**: Use conda Python
- **✅ Expected**: JavaScript errors and matplotlib warnings (non-critical)

**Test AI conversations in the right panel:**
- *"Analyze this property: 123 Oak Street, Portland OR"*
- *"What are market trends for condos in Seattle?"*
- *"Help me qualify a lead with $400k budget"*
- *"Create marketing strategy for luxury listings"*

## Important Lessons Learned (2025-06-27)

### **🚨 CRITICAL Launch Issues Resolved**
During user testing, we discovered several critical issues that required documentation updates:

#### **Issue 1: Virtual Environment Conflicts**
- **Problem**: User tried to use venv which caused PySide6 import errors
- **Root Cause**: System PySide6 packages not available in virtual environment
- **Solution**: Must use system Python `/usr/bin/python3` (not venv, not conda)

#### **Issue 2: Directory Path Confusion**
- **Problem**: User ran from `desktop/src` directory causing "can't open file" errors
- **Root Cause**: Relative path issues when not in correct directory
- **Solution**: Must run from `desktop` directory, not `desktop/src`

#### **Issue 3: Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: ModuleNotFoundError for `requests` and `shortuuid`
- **Root Cause**: These packages needed for property data and AI integration
- **Solution**: Install via system Python: `sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install requests shortuuid --break-system-packages`

#### **Issue 4: Expected vs. Error Messages**
- **Problem**: User confused by JavaScript errors and matplotlib warnings
- **Root Cause**: CMA mapping component generates non-critical JS errors
- **Solution**: Documented these as expected, non-critical warnings

### **✅ Application Successfully Launched**
After resolving these issues, the application launched successfully with:
- Main window with 5 tabs visible
- AI Assistant panel on right side
- All 4 AI agents operational
- Real property data integration working
- 20 realistic leads loaded

### **📚 Documentation Updates Made**
Updated all three key files:
1. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Added comprehensive troubleshooting section
2. **README.md** - Updated installation with correct launch method
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Added critical launch notes and lessons learned

### **🎯 Key Takeaways for Future Sessions**
1. **Always emphasize system Python** (not venv) for GUI applications
2. **Directory matters** - must run from `desktop` not `desktop/src`
3. **JavaScript errors from CMA are normal** - don't worry users
4. **Dependencies must be installed in system Python** if not using venv
5. **User testing reveals real-world issues** that docs miss
