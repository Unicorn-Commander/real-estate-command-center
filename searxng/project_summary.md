# SearXNG Project Summary

This document outlines the purpose and setup of the dedicated SearXNG instance for the Real Estate Commander application.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this dedicated SearXNG instance is to provide a robust, customizable, and self-contained search and data retrieval mechanism for the Real Estate Commander. By running SearXNG within the application's Docker stack, we achieve:

*   **Portability:** The entire application, including its search capabilities, can be easily deployed on different machines without relying on external, pre-existing SearXNG installations.
*   **Isolation:** The SearXNG configuration and data are isolated from other system-wide SearXNG instances, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistent behavior.
*   **Customization:** Allows for fine-grained control over search engines, preferences, and proxy settings specific to the Real Estate Commander's data needs.
*   **Enhanced Data Retrieval:** Serves as a powerful tool for gathering real-time public property data, market trends, and other relevant information by aggregating results from various online sources.

## Key Features

*   **Dockerized Deployment:** Integrated seamlessly into the `docker-compose.yaml` for easy management.
*   **Customizable Settings:** Utilizes a dedicated `settings.yml` for application-specific configurations.
*   **Proxy Support:** Configurable to use proxies (e.g., BrightData) for advanced scraping needs, with default disabled state.
*   **Extensible Engine Support:** Supports adding and configuring custom search engines relevant to real estate data.

## Integration with Real Estate Commander

The Real Estate Commander application will interact with this SearXNG instance via its API to perform:

*   **Geocoding:** Converting addresses to geographical coordinates.
*   **Property Data Scraping:** Gathering information from real estate portals like Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com.
*   **Public Records Discovery:** Locating county assessor and other government public data portals.
*   **Market Research:** Aggregating market trend data from various online sources.

This dedicated SearXNG instance is a critical component in moving the Real Estate Commander from dummy data to real-world, actionable insights.
