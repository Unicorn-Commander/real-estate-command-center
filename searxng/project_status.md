# SearXNG Project Status

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## Status

This SearXNG instance is being integrated as a dedicated search and data retrieval component for the Real Estate Commander application. It is configured to run within the application's Docker stack, ensuring portability and isolated configuration.

## Current Progress

*   **Docker Compose Integration:** SearXNG service added to `docker-compose.yaml`.
*   **Custom Configuration Directory:** `searxng/config/` directory created for custom `settings.yml` and other configurations.
*   **Port Configuration:** Configured to run on external port `7777`.

## Next Steps

*   Populate `searxng/config/settings.yml` with the user's existing custom settings.
*   Integrate user's `.env` file for proxy settings (e.g., BrightData).
*   Integrate any custom search engine configurations.
*   Verify the SearXNG instance is fully functional and accessible from the application.
*   Refine search queries and parsing logic within the application to leverage SearXNG effectively.
